## About
This repository aims to provide a straight forward, simple collection of unit tests anyone can learn from. You can [contribute](#contributing) with your own tests and functionality without any limit; as long as you are respectful and provide useful additions.

## Contributing
Feel free to open an issue/pull request if you have any correction or improvement.

### Adding new tests
You can add tests to existent methods, or add new methods along with its correspondent tests. Whatever you choose,
you will need to fork this repository, create a new branch, commit your changes and then open a pull request.

If you want to add new tests to existent classes/methods, you only need to add them at the end of the correspondent testing class, right after the last test. Instead, if you want to add new functionality and its tests, add your base class and its test class following the scheme of the other ones.

Make sure all of the tests you add are passed by the classes, then make a commit with one of the following descriptions depending on your changes: `Added name_of_test_1, name_of_test_2 to test_class_name` `Implemented new functionality name_of_the_new_class_1, name_of_the_new_class_2`.
